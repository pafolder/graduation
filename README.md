Restaurant Voting Application
=============================

Java Enterprise Graduation Project

Restaurant Voting Application (RVA) implements a Voting System for customers making their decisions
which restaurant to have lunch at. There are two types of users: Admins and regular Users. Admins can
input Restaurants and theirs lunch Menus of the day (dish names with prices). Menus can be provided
in advance for any further date. Users can vote for a restaurant they want to have lunch at today.
Only one vote per user per date counts. If User votes again the same day, the existing vote should be deleted.
Sending and deleting votes is possible if the time does not exceed 11:00. In this case the existing vote cannot be
changed.
